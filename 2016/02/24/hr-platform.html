  HR - platform is a quite simple tool to organize &amp; manage contacts, job applications and events.
  The idea was suggested from a friend of mine back in 2014. But only 1.5 years later it was completed.
  We just delayed a thing. But 6 months ago when I quit a regular job I decided to take matters into own hands.
  The development process itself wasn't really straight. I played with technologies and libraries.
  When I got the first version of it I decided to rewrite it completely. Cause it wasn't really friendly.
  But finally in two months I made it about the same I wanted it.<br />
  And there are few interesting things I want to share with you.

  Interface itself is based on material design. I guess, it's a great solution for small projects and startups. Cause minus one huge headache is taken away. <br /><br /> <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/latest/">Angular Material</a> is used within this project. It has number of primary elements and very probably it's more than enough. Generally it feels like a medium quality lego-constructor. Excellent for small apps, so-so for average and difficult for large ones.

  Application is based on Angular 1.4.8.

  ```javascript
  app.directive("rowWrapFill", function($compile){
  	return {
      restrict: "A",
    	scope: {},
      link: function(scope, elm, attrs){

        if (scope.$parent.$last){
