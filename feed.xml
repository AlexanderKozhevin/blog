        <title>HR-platform</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://polymath-play.xyz/images/blog/post1/main.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;opacity: 0.85;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-content&quot;&gt;

  HR - platform is a quite simple tool to organize &amp;amp; manage contacts, job applications and events.
  The idea was suggested from a friend of mine back in 2014. But only 1.5 years later it was completed.
  We just delayed a thing. But 6 months ago when I quit a regular job I decided to take matters into own hands.
  The development process itself wasn&#39;t really straight. I played with technologies and libraries.
  When I got the first version of it I decided to rewrite it completely. Cause it wasn&#39;t really friendly.
  But finally in two months I made it about the same I wanted it.&lt;br /&gt;
  And there are few interesting things I want to share with you.


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Interface in 1 Minute&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/159079178?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-content&quot;&gt;
  Interface itself is based on material design. I guess, it&#39;s a great solution for small projects and startups. Cause minus one huge headache is taken away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://material.angularjs.org/latest/&quot;&gt;Angular Material&lt;/a&gt; is used within this project. It has number of primary elements and very probably it&#39;s more than enough. Generally it feels like a medium quality lego-constructor. Excellent for small apps, so-so for average and difficult for large ones.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Front-end architecture&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-content&quot;&gt;
  Application is based on Angular 1.4.8.

  ```javascript
  app.directive(&quot;rowWrapFill&quot;, function($compile){
  	return {
      restrict: &quot;A&quot;,
    	scope: {},
      link: function(scope, elm, attrs){

        if (scope.$parent.$last){

  ```

&lt;/div&gt;
